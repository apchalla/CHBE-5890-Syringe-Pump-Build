Fabricated pieces in the assembly included the stepper motor mount, plunger driver, syringe barrel holder, and syringe tip holder, which were dimensioned to fit the manufactured pieces above (and a 19 mm.-diameter syringe). Measurements of fabricated pieces are available from our Fusion 360 model below.

## Pictures of Assembly

As I am studying remotely, Perry provided me with the following image (taken dorsally) of the assembly we built together. Perry assembled the syringe pump in the classroom, while we chatted about the assignment over Zoom; he also answered my questions about the assembly process.

I saved other images of the mechanical assembly as screenshots that I took from Zoom; however, as these images are of understandably lower quality than that above, I also include visualiations of my Fusion 360 model. The first image below is anterolateral, and the second image is a lateral view:
